  ;; not enough room to display any keys in the first location
  ;; (setq which-key-side-window-location 'bottom)

  ;; (setq which-key-side-window-max-width 0.33)
  ;; max height of which-key window, when displayed at top or bottom.

  ;; (setq which-key-side-window-max-height 0.25)

  ;; Set the time delay (in seconds) for the which-key popup to appear. A value of
  ;; zero might cause issues so a non-zero value is recommended.
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 1.0)

  ;; Set the maximum length (in characters) for key descriptions (commands or
  ;; prefixes). Descriptions that are longer are truncated and have ".." added.

  ;; don't impose a maximum.

  ;; Set the separator used between keys and descriptions. Change this setting to
  ;; an ASCII character if your font does not show the default arrow. The second
  ;; setting here allows for extra padding for Unicode characters. which-key uses
  ;; characters as a means of width measurement, so wide Unicode characters can
  ;; throw off the calculation.

  ;; Set the prefix string that will be inserted in front of prefix commands
  ;; (i.e., commands that represent a sub-map).

  ;; Set the special keys. These are automatically truncated to one character and

  ;; Show the key prefix on the left, top, or bottom (nil means hide the prefix).
  ;; The prefix consists of the keys you have typed so far. which-key also shows
  ;; the page information along with the prefix.

  ;; Set to t to show the count of keys shown vs. total keys in the mode line.
